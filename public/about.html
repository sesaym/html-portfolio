<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  My name is Muhammad Sesay and this is my portfolio website. I am currently an Tecnology Development
  Associate at Optum. I am learning the in's and out's of web development so I want to use this portfolio to show
  my progression in web development. I want to use this to show myself and other all of the progress I have made
  starting from zero.
</p>

<p>
  I decided to learn web developoment because it provides me with a broad skillset that will help me further my
  progression in Optum's TDP program. These skills will allow me to contribute to both front end and backend development
  at Optum. It is also fun to learn and broaden my skillset, I am now able to do things I couldnt before and I want to 
  continue to do so.

<p>
  My goals are to add many more projects onto my portfolio. I want to add many more web projects as well as projects in
  golang, and python. I would like to build cloud native applications as well. I want to be able to create anything that
  I can think of!
